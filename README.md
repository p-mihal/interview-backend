# Product service #

## Available endpoints: ##

List all products:
localhost:8080/products

Product detail:
localhost:8080/products/{id}

Price of product for unit:
localhost:8080/products/{id}/prices?unit={unit}

## Requirements: ##

Please implement a service that reads in the provided xml and json files and exposes the information via a RESTful API.

File structure:
- products.xml contains master data for all products.
- prices.json contains price information for all products

The API should be designed in a way, that it allows the following use cases:
1. List all products with their master data

2. Show single product with master data and all available prices

3. Show single product price for one product and specific unit

You can use external libraries.

Out of scope:
- Persistence of data
- Authentication/Authorization
